	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, in computer science, describes how the runtime of an algorithm scales 
		as the input size grows, often expressed using Big O 
		notation. It essentially quantifies the efficiency of an 
		algorithm by measuring how long it takes to complete as a 
		function of the input size. It's a key metric for evaluating how efficient an algorithm is.</p>
	<p> <b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of how much memory an algorithm needs to run, relative to the size of its input. 
		It's a key metric for evaluating how efficient an algorithm is. 
	When we say an algorithm is O(n), we're stating that the amount of time (or space) 
		it takes to complete grows linearly with the size of the input</p>
