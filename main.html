	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. An efficient algorithm has lower time complexity and performs better even with large inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory space that an algorithm uses during its execution. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory linearly proportional to the size of the input.
